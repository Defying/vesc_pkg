<H2>RELEASE NOTES</H2>

Beta. Pubmote and and advanced LED control requires 6.05 firmware on VESC Express and VESC. Run float-accessories-code-server.lisp on the VESC to load code-server library before float package. There is a fallback mode for a basic LED feature without the firmware requirement on VESC side (i.e. no code-server)

There's a ui too but it only works if loaded in PC app on Vesc Tool with saving/loading via config parser I implemented. For some reason VESC Express can't currently load custom qml.
